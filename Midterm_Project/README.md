Technologies used: 
- Raspberry Pi
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS

About the project:
- We tried our best to learn how to implement using a raspberry pi into a website. We chose to use accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to feed data to a website and analyze the data on the project page to showcase to the user.

Website pages (3):
The website has a home "index" landing page, a project page, and an about page. All pages have working navbars.

- The Home Page has a carousel with images and text, showcasing what technologies are used.
- The Project Page has data and graph images showcasing the Raspberry pi accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, and what the data means.
- The About page is a "meet the team" page, containing information about the developers.

Thanks for reading!

-Nick and Tatenda
